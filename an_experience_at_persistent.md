Why work free at persistent?


Stipend

	
Free from college

	
No assignments, No lectures, No exams 
	

	Well money is not everything we desire from internship. People in
	corporate are paid in crores but what to do of so much money when u
	get calls at 2 am or 3 am. No enough sleep. Remember the lines in
	Friends “Paise toh bahot honge par paise karch karne lamhe kam pad
	jayenge”. 
	

	Yeah free from college but college life’s fun. 
	

	Definitely No lullaby, boring lectures. No copied, same as last
	year, wikipedia zindabad assignments. No omitting of mugged up
	answers in exam papers.

	So why work for free at persistent ? 
	

	Learning new things. You get to learn so many new things, new
	Technology, real life problems and most important someone observes
	your buggy, uncommented code recommends changes and you feel like
	updating a post on facebook 
	

	“Just learned programming correctly

	def  main():

	“”” 
	

	main function to print hello world

	“””

	print “Corrected Hello World!”
“.The same code is utilised by someone.

	Free Food. If you are an hostelite and eat at mess/khanawal you
	will definitely love the food at persistent. Defeats every mess in
	pune in terms of hygiene, healthy and edibility.

	Work-life balance. All work and no play makes jack a dull boy.
	Carrom, TT, Badminton are provided. Amateurs are most welcomed.

	Free Gym. Build your body for you will have a 2 months stomach in
	no time(remember free food).

	Pulse: Missing your college day’s inter-departmental
	competition then Pulse it is.You name the game during your college
	days and pulse have it. Treasure Hunt, Beg Borrow Steal, Cricket,
	Back to School, Rangoli etc.

	Get to meet new people. People at persistent are amazing. I have
	seen people who are not in well clothes but are damn good. Down to
	earth people( Never judge a book by its cover). Vidya vinayena
	shobate.

	Even I met few people worth blogging about.

	Rashmi: Why would someone work at persistent for 15 years ? And
	that too cheerful, smart, friendly, clever, caring person. The only
	answer I could think of is people and life at persistent. She was my
	first and best, amazing manager. Always Cheerful, fun to talk to. A
	big smile on face makes the problem so small that it ceases to
	exist.( Never thought of solving a problem with this attitude)

	Adwait: The cool guy in persistent. Chat with him and your
	problem is solved. Deflect from the track he puts you right back on
	track.

	Three friends who made sure I continue my college life even at
	persistent as if they are paid to do so.

	Deepika: She was my colleague for just few minutes after
	beginning our first conversation. Friendly, caring, cheerful,
	Enthusiastic, Fun to talk to. Her VM and its problems. They range
	from extracting in wrong folder to kernel panic. Whose going to
	solve her problems from tomorrow dont know ?? But her hardwork pays
	off for her. Enjoyed decorating desks on birthdays.

	Akshay: The most famous guy in Bhageerath office. Everyone knows
	him and he knows everyone. His jokes and scenes are worth hearing.
	Never seen this guy angry. I still wonder how can this 5 ft 6 inch
	guy with weight in 50s hit the badminton racket so hard ?

	Rewati: Blah Blah Blah!!! Never stops talking. Typical Indian
	girl. Consider keeping fast of no word rather than no food. But it
	doesn’t feel good even when she doesn’t talk.

	I will miss you guys a lot. It was fun spending some worthy time
	with you. The topics at lunch, scenes and jokes of akshay, fun at
	pulse, Cheering for others.
